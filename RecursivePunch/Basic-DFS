1. DFS:

               1
              / \
             2   3
            /|   |\
           4 5   6 7
   Always remember visit not the same as traversal
It has 3 styles:
1. pre-order:
- root
- down to the left leaf.
- turn right
- continue with the rest
=> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7
2. in-order:
=> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6 > 3 -> 7
3. post-order:
postOder():
postOrder():
visitcurentNode
=> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3 -> 1

NOTE:
13/08/24: i have gain meaningful insights from gods.
i understand how recursion in tree work now. Such a rewarded achievement.
that is for DFS.
I can crack easy DFS like pre-order, in-order, post-order like piece of cake. Before this,
it was really a big struggle for my mental.

I think that why i feel thankful for the time I has spent on this problem. These times builds up
my understandings central to the DFS. Overtime, I realized by these building bricks it finally break
into a realization bring me such a great insightful for this specific problem but also enlighten me
a broader acknowledgement about a bigger thing that the process for understanding, belief about myself,
and the reward through commitment of time I have dedicated to.

Again, big congrats, happy coding!
