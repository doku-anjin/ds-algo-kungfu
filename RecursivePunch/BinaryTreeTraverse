1. DFS:

               1
              / \
             2   3
            /|   |\
           4 5   6 7
   Always remember visit not the same as traversal
It has 3 styles:
1. pre-order:
- root
- down to the left leaf.
- turn right
- continue with the rest
=> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7
2. in-order:
=> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6 > 3 -> 7
3. post-order:
postOder():

=> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3 -> 1
